## Money and Life: A Personal Journey

From my childhood in a lower middle-class family in a major Latin American city to my 42 years, the financial journey has always been a mix of small victories and significant challenges. I started working at the age of 12, and since then, my life has been a constant battle against bills and debts while simultaneously achieving milestones such as university graduation, purchasing used cars, and acquiring a small apartment.

For a long time, I felt dissatisfied, always comparing my path with that of friends and the idealised versions presented on social media. The constant societal pressures about saving and planning for retirement only increased my angst. I questioned myself: "Will I ever achieve my dreams, such as the ideal home or the trips I so desire?"

Everything began to change in 2020, when the global pandemic forced us to rethink our lives. With more free time, I dived into the world of personal finance. I discovered, through free resources on YouTube and blogs, three fundamental pillars: **Earn, Spend and Invest**. These concepts, although simple, reorganised my perception of money.

Today, I maintain a healthy relationship with finances. I've learned to plan for the present and the future without the pressure to accumulate wealth immediately. This relief has transformed not just my financial health but also my quality of life.

### What life has taught me:

* Life teaches us to go to school, to university, buy a house, get married, and have kids.
* To work our entire lives, putting money into pension plans and building a good career.
* To spend 70% of our childhood in school, learning how to be a worker.
* To be levelled by academic intelligence — the more degrees, the better.
* With the hope that we don't die before we can truly enjoy the fruits of our labour.
* That exams are the most important things in life.
* To complain without proposing solutions.
* To know my rights, but never my duties.
* That social status is very important.

### What life didn’t teach me (but I learned):

* How to handle feelings, mine and others'.
* How to manage personal finances.
* How to pay my taxes and how to avoid them.
* How to be a genuinely good person and be capable of maintaining a conversation.
* How to build relationships and have experiences.

### Valuable lessons:

* To have practical knowledge that produces results, instead of accumulating degrees.
* If deciding not to venture, be the best worker and work where you're valued.
* To enjoy life during life and not just at the end of it.
* It’s impossible to live without money.
* We don’t always need as much money as we think — Social Media Trauma.
* Money behaves very well under discipline and routine.
* The money is yours. The taxes are yours. The pension plan is yours. Learn to deal with all of them.
* Seek self-knowledge. Know what makes you happy.
* Practice volunteering and give back to the world.
* Be prepared for emergencies.
* Personal finances will rarely be mandatory in the school curriculum.
* Know your whys.
* Never lose money.
* Bad things happen — make lemonade out of lemons.
* Worry more about yourself. Don't let people put you down.
* Be patient. Be responsible for your own destiny.
* If you're going to complain, propose at least 2 solutions.

### Quotes to reflect on:

* "What is not measured is not manageable." — W. Edwards Deming
* "Planting is optional, but harvesting is mandatory."
* "Dreams without plans will remain just dreams."
* "He who runs gets tired, he who walks achieves"

Through these reflections and changes, I began to live a fuller life, without the constant concern for money. My wish is that this text inspires others to find peace and purpose in their own financial journeys.
